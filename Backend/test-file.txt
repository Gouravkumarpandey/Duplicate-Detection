This is a test file for the duplicate detection system.
It contains sample text content that will be used to test:
1. Text extraction from .txt files
2. SHA-256 hash calculation
3. Duplicate detection in MongoDB
4. File storage to /uploads folder

The file upload endpoint should process this file and:
- Extract this text content using BufferedReader
- Calculate a SHA-256 hash of the content
- Check MongoDB for existing files with the same hash
- Save the file to the uploads directory
- Store metadata in MongoDB

This is the enhanced file upload system implementation.
